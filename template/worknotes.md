daytemplate.html has a bunch of stuff set to my name and my writing in divFooter.

this should be example code, not specific stuff for me. 

and interestingly, this mistake broke my own site, because the copyright date is hard-coded.

i didn't change anything, and when 2027 rolls around i'll have to make the same fix. 

now where to put a pointer to this note so i'm sure to find it?

Changed the font-size of divStoryPageTitle from 48 to 40 px. 

I want more space for title text.

Re-did the social media links for story pages. 

Used to be just RSS and Linkedin.

I got rid of Linkedin because I never use it.

Added Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads.

Debated whether to remove Twitter, but it is still a way to follow my posts, the ones that go out through the linkblog. A lot of people still use Twitter. 

Had to include the latest version of Font-Awesome, but since my story pages don't otherwise use FA, I figured nothing could break. Haha. ;-)

The links page comes from the new FeedLand-based linkblog feed.

The About page outline is moved to my public folder so I can edit it in E/D.

Replaced daytemplate.css and daytemplate.js with new versions that support the tabbed home page.

It's called daytemplate but it's not -- it's the only template, used for the home page, for the monthly archive pages and for the extra pages (linkblog, river etc).
